## 📊 Before vs After

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Login System | Simple username/password | Firebase authentication |
| User Accounts | None | Full registration system |
| Merch Shop | None | ✅ Complete shop |
| Shopping Cart | None | ✅ Full cart system |
| Checkout | None | ✅ Order processing |
| Database | None | ✅ Firebase Realtime DB |
| Orders Storage | None | ✅ Saved to database |
| Admin Access | Username/password | Email-based |

## 🔒 Security Improvements

- ✅ Passwords encrypted by Firebase (never stored in plain text)
- ✅ Secure authentication via Google's infrastructure
- ✅ HTTPS required for production (automatic on Netlify)
- ✅ Database security rules can be configured
- ✅ Admin privileges based on email verification

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Admin Email**: The email `admin@gutech.edu.om` is hardcoded as admin. Change it in `auth.js` line 7 if needed.

2. **Product Images**: Use direct image URLs from services like:
   - Imgur
   - Google Drive (public link)
   - Cloudinary
   - Any CDN

3. **Cart Persistence**: Cart is saved in browser localStorage, so it persists even without Firebase.

4. **Testing Orders**: Check Firebase Console → Realtime Database → orders to see all orders.

5. **Customization**: All colors can be changed in `style.css` by searching for `#8b5cf6` (purple) and `#10b981` (green).

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Firebase not working?
→ Make sure you added YOUR credentials to `firebase-config.js`  
→ Check if Authentication and Database are enabled in Firebase Console

### Can't see admin buttons?
→ Login with `admin@gutech.edu.om` email  
→ Refresh page after logging in

### Orders not saving?
→ Enable Realtime Database in Firebase Console  
→ Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Cart not working?
→ Cart works even without Firebase (uses localStorage)  
→ Don't clear browser data
