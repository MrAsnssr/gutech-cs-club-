## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Data Persistence**: 
All changes are stored in the browser's memory only. If you refresh the page, any new content added or edits made will be lost. The page will return to its original state.

For permanent changes, you need to:
1. Edit the `index.html` file directly, or
2. Implement a backend database system

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security**: 
This admin system is for demonstration/development purposes. For production use, implement proper server-side authentication.

## Browser Compatibility

The admin panel works on:
- ‚úÖ Google Chrome (recommended)
- ‚úÖ Mozilla Firefox
- ‚úÖ Microsoft Edge
- ‚úÖ Safari
- ‚úÖ Mobile browsers (responsive design)
